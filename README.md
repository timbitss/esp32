# **ESP32 Projects**

- [Blinky](blinky/)

## **Notes**
* [Espressif's ESP-IDF framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) must be installed on user's host machine to build and flash the above projects. 

* The c_cpp_properties.json located in .vscode/ was added to take advantage of VSCode's IntelliSense feature. Hence, the configuration file is not required for compilation.
