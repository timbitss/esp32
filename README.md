# **ESP32 Projects**

- [Blinky](blinky/)

## **Notes**
* [Espressif's ESP-IDF framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) must be installed on user's host machine to build and flash the above projects. 

* The [c_cpp_properties.json](.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json) file was added merely to take advantage of VSCode's IntelliSense feature; it is not required for compilation.
